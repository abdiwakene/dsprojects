    "\n",
    "#### 1. *Data Collection*: Collect a dataset for text classification. This could be movie reviews, tweets, or any text data. Make sure the data is labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. *Text Preprocessing*: This is an important step in any NLP project. Text preprocessing includes:\n",
    "- Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words.\n",
    "- Stopwords Removal: Stopwords are common words that do not contribute much to the model’s understanding.\n",
    "- Lemmatization/Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. *Feature Extraction*: Transform the text data into feature vectors so they can be used in the model. Techniques include:\n",
    "- Bag of Words\n",
    "- TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. *Model Building*: Choose a model to classify the texts based on the features. You could use:\n",
    "- Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "- Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "- Deep Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. *Training and Testing*: Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train your model on the training set and test it on the testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. *Evaluation*: Evaluate your model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a simple implementation of this in Python:\n"
